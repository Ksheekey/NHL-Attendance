Does record affect crowd size?

TEST

2003 Lockout season
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NHL_season

2021 no fans (covid)

2013 lockout by franchise owners - started 1/19 - 48 game season
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_NHL_season

Because of the 2013 shortened season I had to rank each season so that it would be consistent even with the shortened season
